### Hello there! 👋

I'm **Tamás Fokti**, an ICT student from Kecskemét, Hungary. 
Currently, I am: 
- Developing a self-improvement app 💪
- Improving my networking skills 🌐
- Attending High School 📚

Computers have been a crucial part of my life since childhood, fueling my curiosity about the hows of the internet. I began my journey in ICT during primary school, and my passion for web development has only grown stronger over the years.

Throughout my learning journey, I've tried various programming areas such as game development with Unity and software development in Python and C#. However, it's web development that has truly captivated me.

In the past year, I've been focused on improving my web development skills even further, achieving intermediate levels in Vue.js and Node.js. 🚀 It's been an enriching experience, and I'm excited to continue my journey in this wonderful field.
